# CURSOR RULES FOR BRANDED + FLOW

## 🚨 MANDATORY - READ BEFORE ANY ACTION

**Before creating, moving, or modifying ANY files:**

1. **READ FIRST:** `/Users/jencortez-walters/brandedflow/AI_RULES.md`
2. **READ CONTEXT:** `/Users/jencortez-walters/brandedflow/docs/CONTEXT.md`
3. **FOLLOW CHECKLIST:** `/Users/jencortez-walters/brandedflow/company/operations/UPDATE_CHECKLIST.md`

## 📁 FOLDER STRUCTURE (DO NOT VIOLATE)

Only 6 folders exist at root level:
- `clients/` - Client work
- `company/` - Company operations
- `docs/` - All documentation
- `automations/` - Reusable automation
- `systems/` - Operational systems
- `templates/` - Templates

**NEVER create folders at root level. NEVER use CAPS or underscores in folder names.**

## 📝 NAMING CONVENTION

- Files: `lowercase-kebab-case.md`
- Folders: `lowercase-kebab-case/`
- NO spaces, NO underscores, NO CAPS (except established docs like CONTEXT.md)

## ⚠️ CURSOR COMPOSER SPECIFIC RULES

You are Cursor Composer. You have a tendency to:
- Create entire folder structures without asking
- Use root-level folders (DON'T DO THIS)
- Forget to update documentation

**STOP before creating:**
1. Check if it already exists
2. Ask where it should go if unsure
3. Use established folder structure
4. Update docs/CONTEXT.md and docs/DECISIONS_LOG.md after

## 🎯 DOE METHOD - MANDATORY WORKFLOW

**Before executing ANY task, follow the Directive → Orchestrate → Execute pattern:**

### Step 1: Assess Task (3-Question Test)
Before using DOE, quickly assess:
1. **Will this be done again?** (Recurring task)
2. **Is this complex?** (Multiple steps, integrations, error-prone)
3. **Does consistency matter?** (Same quality every time)

**If 2+ answers are "Yes" → Use DOE**
**If 0-1 answers are "Yes" → Skip DOE, do it directly**

### Step 2: Check for Directive (If Using DOE)
1. Search for existing directive: `systems/doe-engine/directives/{task-name}.md`
2. If directive exists: Read it fully before proceeding
3. If no directive exists:
   - For common/recurring tasks: Ask user if you should create one
   - For one-off tasks: Proceed but note what directive could be created

### Step 3: Check for Execution Scripts (If Using DOE)
1. Before writing code, check: `systems/doe-engine/execution/`
2. If script exists: Use it (don't rewrite)
3. If no script exists: Create one for deterministic operations
4. Only write code directly if it's exploratory/prototyping

### Step 4: Orchestrate (Your Role)
- Read directive → Understand goals/inputs/outputs
- Decide which execution scripts to call
- Handle errors and edge cases
- Update directive with learnings (ask permission first)

### Step 5: Self-Anneal on Errors
When something breaks:
1. Fix the execution script
2. Test it (ask before using paid APIs)
3. Update the directive with new learnings (ask permission)
4. Document what changed

**Key Principle:** Push complexity into deterministic scripts. You orchestrate, scripts execute.

**See:** `systems/doe-engine/gemini.md` for full architecture details

## 🔄 AFTER MAKING CHANGES

**ALWAYS update:**
- `docs/CONTEXT.md` - If affects priorities/status
- `docs/DECISIONS_LOG.md` - If significant decision
- Relevant docs per `company/operations/UPDATE_CHECKLIST.md`

**ALWAYS commit to git with clear message**

## 📖 FULL RULES

See `/Users/jencortez-walters/brandedflow/AI_RULES.md` for complete rules.

**When in doubt, ASK THE USER before creating files/folders.**
