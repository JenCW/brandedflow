## What "Managed" Means

**DIY is great if:**
- You have time to manage systems yourself
- You enjoy tech and want to learn
- You're on a tight budget

**Managed is perfect if:**
- You want to focus on your actual work (not managing tech)
- You want systems that get BETTER every month (not just maintained)
- You'd rather pay monthly than do it yourself

**With Managed, we:**
- Actively improve performance (not just keep it running)
- Add new automations as your business grows
- Monitor, optimize, and report on performance
- Handle everything so you don't have to think about it
- Make strategic recommendations based on data

**Examples of what we do monthly on Managed plans:**
- A/B test email subject lines and landing page copy
- Add new lead magnets and landing pages
- Optimize AI receptionist scripts based on actual calls
- Build new automations for tasks you're doing manually
- Analyze data and recommend improvements
- Update website content based on what's converting
