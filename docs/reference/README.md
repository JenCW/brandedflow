# Reference Documents

This directory contains reference materials that are **NOT enforcement rules**.

## What These Files Are

These documents provide:
- Historical context
- Examples and patterns
- Explanations and philosophy
- Checklists and notes

## What These Files Are NOT

These documents do NOT:
- Block or stop work
- Override enforcement rules
- Require reading before action
- Contain mandatory rules

## Enforcement Rules (The Only Ones That Matter)

The only files that control behavior are:
1. `.cursorrules` (auto-loaded by Cursor)
2. `systems/doe-engine/ACTIVE_DIRECTIVE.md` (explicitly checked)

Everything else is optional reference material.
