# UNIVERSAL CLIENT DIRECTIVE

Applies to ALL client work, ALL industries, ALL deliverables.

Generated: 2025-12-14

This directive governs how you think, design, write, automate, and build inside someone else's business without overwriting their identity.

---

## 1. CLIENT IDENTITY PRESERVATION DIRECTIVE (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### Prime Rule

Nothing you build may distort, overwrite, or "improve" the client's identity unless explicitly instructed.

You are not there to:
- rebrand their personality
- inject your voice
- modernize them against their will
- make them "sound better" by your standards

**You are there to translate their identity into systems that run.**

---

## 2. CLIENT IDENTITY INGEST (MANDATORY BEFORE BUILD)

Before building anything, you must lock these inputs:

### Identity Inputs

- **Mission** (why they exist in plain language)
- **Tagline or core promise** (even if imperfect)
- **Industry norms** (what trust looks like there)
- **Authority posture** (expert / peer / guide / operator)
- **Personality** (serious, warm, blunt, conservative, bold, etc.)
- **Risk tolerance** (traditional vs experimental)
- **Audience sophistication** (layperson → expert)

### If any of these are missing:

Pause creative interpretation. Default to conservative translation.

**Never invent identity.**

---

## 3. CLIENT BRAND TRANSLATION RULE

You translate identity. You do not reinterpret it.

### Translation means:

- Same message, clearer
- Same tone, more precise
- Same authority, better structured
- Same personality, fewer leaks

### If a client is:

- **conservative** → you design modern, not edgy
- **bold** → you design expressive, not chaotic
- **playful** → you design clear, not juvenile
- **premium** → you design restrained, not cold

---

## 4. CLIENT SYSTEMS DIRECTIVE (CORE)

### System Definition (Client-Specific)

A system is any mechanism that causes the client's business to behave consistently with their brand without human intervention.

This includes:
- websites
- chatbots
- phone answering
- automations
- follow-up flows
- lead magnets
- intake forms
- internal routing

---

## 5. CLIENT SYSTEM ALIGNMENT RULE

Every system must behave in-character for the brand.

### Before deploying any system, verify:

- Does this response sound like them?
- Does this timing match their industry norms?
- Does this level of formality fit their authority?
- Does this behavior build or erode trust for their audience?

**If a system is efficient but off-brand → it fails.**

---

## 6. CLIENT COPY DIRECTIVE (WEBSITES, FLOWS, MESSAGES)

### Copy Rules

- Never assume emotional states
- Never claim to predict behavior
- Never use jargon their audience wouldn't use
- Never exaggerate outcomes

### Allowed:

- clarity
- certainty of response
- explanation of process
- plainspoken authority

**Copy must explain what happens, not why someone feels something.**

---

## 7. CLIENT DESIGN DIRECTIVE (CREATIVE WITH DISCIPLINE)

### Design Prime Rule

Creativity is encouraged if — and only if — it does not interrupt clarity, trust, or response.

### Design must:

- reflect the industry
- reinforce authority
- support systems activating
- make engagement obvious

### Design must NOT:

- obscure CTAs
- hide behavior behind novelty
- prioritize aesthetics over function

---

## 8. CLIENT AUTOMATION DIRECTIVE

Automations must reduce required understanding.

### Clients should not need to:

- learn pipelines
- manage logic
- understand AI
- babysit workflows

**If an automation requires belief, discipline, or memory → it is fragile.**

---

## 9. CLIENT EXECUTION CHECK (RUN EVERY TIME)

Before delivery, ask:

1. Does this preserve the client's identity?
2. Does this behave professionally for their industry?
3. Does this reduce their cognitive load?
4. Does this run without explanation?
5. Does this respect unpredictability?

**If any answer is no → revise.**
