# Daily Startup Routine
**Do this EVERY morning before checking phone/email**

## THE NON-NEGOTIABLES (15 minutes)

### 1. Check Yesterday's Progress
- [ ] Did I complete my 3 priorities?
- [ ] What got in the way?
- [ ] What worked well?

### 2. Today's 3 Priorities
Write these on today's sheet:
1. Revenue-generating priority (client work, sales, follow-ups)
2. Business-building priority (content, systems, outreach)
3. Admin/operations priority (invoicing, scheduling, cleanup)

### 3. Time Blocks
Assign each priority a specific time block:
- Priority 1: _____ to _____
- Priority 2: _____ to _____
- Priority 3: _____ to _____

### 4. Check These Lists
- [ ] Client deliverables due this week
- [ ] Follow-ups needed today
- [ ] Any fires to put out?

## THEN Start Work
**No email, no social media until Priority 1 is done**

---

## Evening Shutdown (5 minutes)
- [ ] Mark off completed priorities
- [ ] Move incomplete items to tomorrow
- [ ] Brain dump any open loops
- [ ] Write down biggest win today
- [ ] Set tomorrow's Priority 1

**Leave work behind. Shut the door mentally.**
