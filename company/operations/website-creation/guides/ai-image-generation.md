# AI Image Generation Guide for Portfolio

## Critical Requirements

**ALL images must be:**
- ✅ **Photorealistic** - Look like actual photographs, not AI art
- ✅ **High-end luxury** - Premium finishes, sophisticated design
- ✅ **Professional quality** - No obvious AI artifacts, perfect lighting
- ✅ **Indistinguishable from real photos** - Must pass as actual project photos

## Tools for High-End Photorealistic Images

### Recommended AI Tools (Best Quality):

1. **Midjourney v6** (Best for photorealistic)
   - Use `--style raw` for most realistic results
   - Prompt: `photorealistic luxury [space type], professional architectural photography, high-end finishes, natural lighting, 8k, ultra detailed, no AI artifacts --style raw --ar 16:9`

2. **DALL-E 3** (Good for consistency)
   - Use detailed prompts with "professional photography" emphasis
   - Specify camera settings: "shot with Canon 5D, 24mm lens, f/2.8"

3. **Stable Diffusion XL** (Free option)
   - Use photorealistic checkpoints like "Realistic Vision" or "DreamShaper"
   - Use negative prompts: "cartoon, illustration, painting, AI generated, fake"

1. **Use Photoshop/Lightroom** to:
   - Adjust color grading to match real photos

   - Match color profiles of real project photos

2. **Avoid AI Tells:**
   - Too perfect symmetry
   - Unrealistic lighting
   - Strange text/patterns
   - Overly smooth surfaces
   - Unnatural reflections
