# Website Creation Workflow - Stepped Approval Process

## Overview

## Approval Workflow

### How It Works
1. **Complete Step** → MCP generates deliverables
2. **Review** → You review the deliverables
3. **Iterate** → Make changes, regenerate if needed
4. **Approve** → Click "Approve Step X" button
5. **Next Step** → System unlocks next step

### Approval Button
Each step has an "Approve Step X" button that:
- Updates client profile status
- Unlocks next step
- Records approval date
- Allows notes/comments

### Iteration
- You can iterate on each step for 24+ hours
- No time limit
- Regenerate deliverables as many times as needed
- Only approve when you're 100% satisfied

## Key Principles

1. **No Deployment Until All Approved** - Website doesn't go live until Step 5 is approved
2. **ROI Starts at Deployment** - Analytics and ROI tracking begin immediately upon deployment
3. **Iteration is Expected** - Take your time, be particular, iterate as needed
4. **Simple & Understandable** - Site plans and wireframes are in plain language, not technical
5. **ROI-Focused** - Everything from deployment forward is about proving value

## ROI Tracking (Starts at Deployment)

**What Gets Tracked:**
- Website traffic (organic, direct, referral)
- Form submissions
- Contact inquiries
- Conversions
