# Branded+Flow — Website Brief (Reusable Master)
Date: 2025-12-07

## 1) Purpose (why this website exists)
**Primary job:** convert overwhelmed small-business owners into qualified leads for Branded+Flow.  
**Secondary job:** reduce anxiety by explaining brand + automation in plain English and showing a clear next step.

## 2) Target visitor (who this is for)
**People who:**
- run a small business / are self-employed
- feel overwhelmed by marketing + AI jargon
- are doing too much manually (leads, follow-up, onboarding, admin)
- want results, not theory

**Common feelings (lead with this):** overwhelmed, anxious, exhausted, stuck, behind/embarrassed, lonely doing it all.

## 3) The problem (in their words)
- “I don’t know what to say or how to explain what I do.”
- “Marketing feels like a foreign language.”
- “AI feels like a train I can’t catch.”
- “I’m dropping leads and forgetting follow-ups.”
- “I’m doing everything myself and it’s too much.”

## 4) The promise (what relief we deliver)
We turn chaos into **clarity + follow-through**:
- **Brand Backbone:** clear message, offers, and voice so people “get it” fast
- **Automation Spine:** simple workflows so leads and clients move forward without you pushing every button

**Result:** less anxiety, more control, more leads, more time.

## 5) One-line positioning statement
**Branded+Flow translates marketing + AI into simple steps—and implements brand + automation systems that keep business moving even on hard days.**

## 6) Core method (the “how it works” section)
### Step 1 — Clarify
We tighten what you do, who it’s for, and what the next step is.
### Step 2 — Build
We connect intake → CRM → follow-up → onboarding (automation spine).
### Step 3 — Run
We document it, set the cadence, and make it stick.

## 7) Offers (simple, non-confusing)
**Offer A — “Clarity Sprint”**  
Brand Backbone: message, offers, simple page plan.

**Offer B — “Automation Build”**  
Automation Spine: intake + CRM + follow-up + onboarding.

**Offer C — “Backbone + Spine”**  
Both together (best-fit for overwhelmed owners).

*(Offer names are placeholders—rename later.)*

## 8) Calls-to-action (CTAs)
**Primary CTA (site-wide):** “Start here: 5-minute intake”  
**Secondary CTA:** “See packages” or “Request a build quote”

**Communication boundary (to reduce friction):**  
Async-first by default. No surprise calls.

## 9) Pages needed (minimum viable site)
1. **Home** (emotion-first + method + offers + proof + CTA)
2. **Services** (3 offers + deliverables + timelines)
3. **About** (credibility + approach + what it’s like to work together)
4. **FAQ** (objections + “do I need to be techy?” + “do I need calls?”)
5. **Start Here / Intake** (form + what happens next)
6. **Privacy Policy**
7. **Terms / Service Agreement (simple)**

Optional:
- Case Studies
- Resources / Glossary (plain-English definitions)

## 10) Homepage wireframe (what goes where)
1. **Hero:** name the feelings + promise + CTA  
2. **Why it feels hard:** marketing speak + AI overwhelm + no system  
3. **What we do:** Brand Backbone + Automation Spine  
4. **How it works:** Clarify → Build → Run  
5. **Services:** 3 offers (Start / Build / Run)  
6. **Proof:** mini-wins, screenshots, quotes  
7. **Objections:** “I’m not techy” / “I’m behind” / “I hate sales”  
8. **About preview:** who we are + how we work  
9. **CTA repeated:** intake
