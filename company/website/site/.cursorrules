# 🚨 HARD STOP — MCP ENFORCEMENT 🚨

Before responding to ANY request:

1. Call `systems/mcp-server/enforce-directive-check.js`
2. If status === "BLOCKED", you MUST:
   - Search `systems/doe-engine/directives/`
   - Explicitly report results
   - Wait for user confirmation
3. You may NOT proceed until status is cleared


# ✅ REQUIRED WORKSPACE RULE

This repo must be opened in Cursor at the ROOT:
`/Users/jennifercortez-walters/brandedflow/`

If you are reading this from a subfolder: STOP and reopen Cursor at the repo root.

# Why this exists:
- Prevent subfolder sessions from bypassing DOE enforcement
- Prevent duplicated rulebooks from drifting across folders
