# How to Add 6 Video Testimonials from iPhone Messages to Home Page

## Quick Steps (AirDrop Method - Easiest)

### Step 1: On Your iPhone
1. Open the **Messages** app
2. Find the conversation with the 6 testimonial videos
3. For each video:
   - **Long-press** on the video
   - Tap **"Share"**
   - Tap **"AirDrop"**
   - Select your **Mac** from the list
   - Wait for it to send

### Step 2: On Your Mac
1. When AirDrop notification appears, click **"Accept"**
2. The video will download to your **Downloads** folder
3. Open **Finder** and go to Downloads
4. **Drag the video** to this folder:
   ```
   /Users/jencortez-walters/brandedflow/clients/aq-remodeling/03_website/images/Work-pics-and-vids
   ```

### Step 3: Rename the Videos (Important!)
The website is looking for these specific filenames. After you add each video, rename them to:

1. `IMG_6988.MOV` (or keep original name if it's already this)
2. `IMG_6949.MOV`
3. `IMG_6831.MOV`
4. `IMG_6770.MOV`
5. `IMG_6190.MOV`
6. `IMG_6189.MOV`

**OR** - If you want to use different names, I can update the HTML to match whatever you name them.

## After Adding Videos

Once the videos are in the folder:
1. The website will automatically find them (they're already linked in the HTML)
2. Refresh the browser to see them
3. The videos will play directly on the home page

## Current Video References in HTML

The home page is currently looking for these 6 videos:
- `images/Work-pics-and-vids/IMG_6988.MOV`
- `images/Work-pics-and-vids/IMG_6949.MOV`
- `images/Work-pics-and-vids/IMG_6831.MOV`
- `images/Work-pics-and-vids/IMG_6770.MOV`
- `images/Work-pics-and-vids/IMG_6190.MOV`
- `images/Work-pics-and-vids/IMG_6189.MOV`

**If your videos have different names**, just tell me what you named them and I'll update the HTML to match!

## Troubleshooting

**"Videos not showing"**
- Make sure videos are in the correct folder
- Check that filenames match exactly (case-sensitive)
- Try hard refresh: Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows)

**"Videos won't play"**
- MOV files should work in modern browsers
- If needed, we can convert to MP4 format

**"Can't find videos in Messages"**
- Scroll up in the conversation - videos might be older messages
- Check if videos were sent in a group chat
- Videos might be in a different conversation thread
