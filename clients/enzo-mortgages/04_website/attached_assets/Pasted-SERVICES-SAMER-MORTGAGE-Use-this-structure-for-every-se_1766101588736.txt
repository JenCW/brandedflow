Headline

Foreign National Mortgage Loans — Handled Correctly

Subheadline

Clear guidance for international buyers and investors purchasing property in the United States — even without U.S. income or residency.

Body Copy

Buying property in the U.S. as a foreign national comes with additional layers of complexity — documentation, income verification, currency considerations, and lender requirements that aren’t always clearly explained.

Samer Mahmoud specializes in foreign national and international investor loans. He understands how these files are underwritten, what lenders actually look for, and how to structure applications so they move forward smoothly.

This is not a one-size-fits-all process. The right approach depends on your residency status, income source, assets, and long-term goals. Sam works through those details carefully so you can invest with confidence.

What This Covers
	•	Foreign national purchase loans
	•	International investor financing
	•	ITIN / non-U.S. borrower scenarios
	•	High-value and multi-property transactions

Headline

Refinancing — With a Clear Strategy

Subheadline

A calm, honest review of your current loan and whether refinancing actually makes sense.

Body Copy

Refinancing isn’t always the right move — and Sam is upfront about that. Every refinance starts with a review of your current loan, your goals, and what you’re trying to accomplish.

Whether you’re looking to lower your payment, adjust your loan term, or improve cash flow, Sam helps you understand the trade-offs so you can make an informed decision.

No pressure. Just clarity.
