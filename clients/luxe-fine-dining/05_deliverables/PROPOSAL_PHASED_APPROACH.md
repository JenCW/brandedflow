## 💡 WHY MANAGED SERVICE IS WORTH IT

### DIY vs MANAGED - THE REAL COST

**If you did it yourself (DIY):**
- Setup: $14,500 one-time
- Your time: 20-30 hours/week managing systems
- Your hourly rate: $50-100/hour
- Monthly time cost: $4,000-12,000/month
- **Total Year 1: $14,500 + $48,000-144,000 (time) = $62,500-158,500**

**Managed Service:**
- Setup: $7,000 (if all phases)
- Monthly: $1,497/month
- Your time: 0 hours (we handle it)
- **Total Year 1: $7,000 + $17,964 = $24,964**

**You save: $37,536-133,536 in Year 1**

### WHAT YOU GET WITH MANAGED (That DIY Doesn't)

| Service | DIY | Managed | Value |
|---------|-----|---------|-------|
| Ongoing SEO monitoring | ❌ | ✅ | $300-600/month |
