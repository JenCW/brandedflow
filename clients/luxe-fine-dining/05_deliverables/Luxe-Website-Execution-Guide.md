# PART 1: BRAND VOICE & TONE

## The Luxe Personality

Upscale. Modern. Edgy. Sophisticated. This isn't your grandmother's fine dining experience — it's refined without being stuffy, elegant without being pretentious, and memorable without trying too hard.

## Voice Characteristics

- **Confident, not arrogant.** We know we're good. We don't need to oversell it.
- **Warm, not cheesy.** Hospitality runs deep, but we're not going to hug you at the door.
- **Playful, not gimmicky.** A wink, not a punchline.
- **Sophisticated, not stuffy.** Martinis and live music, not white tablecloths and silence.

## Words We Use

Elevated • Crafted • Curated • Unforgettable • Effortless • Exceptional • Iconic • Obsessed

## Words We Avoid

Journey (overused) • Synergy • Best-in-class • World-class • Revolutionary • Disrupt • Solutions • Family (unless talking about Jimmy & Cindy)

## Sentence Structure

Short. Punchy. Let the reader lean in. Then reward them.

Long sentences are fine when they build rhythm and momentum, drawing the reader through the experience the way a great meal unfolds — one course at a time, each better than the last.

---

# PART 2: HOMEPAGE — THE GATEWAY

## HERO SECTION

### The Luxe Dining Experience

**Subheading:** Fine Dining & Event Catering — with a twist.

**Visual:** Full-screen video or high-impact hero image. Moody lighting. Martini glass prominent. The vibe should say "this place is different" within 2 seconds.

**Interaction:** Subtle animation — martini glass click triggers reveal of the two paths below.

---

## THE REVEAL — TWO PATHS

After hero scroll or martini animation click, two side-by-side containers appear:

### Left Container: The Restaurant

- **Headline:** The Restaurant
- **Supporting copy:** The bar. The bites. The vibe.
- **CTA Button:** Make a Reservation
- **Visual:** Interior shot — bar, ambient lighting, people enjoying themselves

### Right Container: Private Events

- **Headline:** Private Events
- **Supporting copy:** Your event. Our obsession.
- **CTA Button:** Plan Your Event
- **Visual:** Elegant catered event, plated dish in action, or private dining setup

---

## SOCIAL PROOF STRIP

Immediately after the two-path reveal, a subtle horizontal strip:

> "Dana Point's destination for fine dining since 2010" • ★★★★★ 4.8 on Yelp • Featured in Orange Coast Magazine

---

## THE STORY (OPTIONAL SECTION)

### More Than a Restaurant

When Jimmy and Cindy opened Luxe in 2010, they had one rule: no ordinary nights. Every dish crafted. Every cocktail considered. Every guest remembered.

Fifteen years later, that obsession hasn't faded. Neither has the team — most of the staff has been here since day one. That's not loyalty. That's family.

**CTA:** Meet the Team →

# PART 3: THE RESTAURANT JOURNEY

**URL:** luxefinedining.com/restaurant or luxefinedining.com/dine

---

## HERO

### The Restaurant & Martini Bar

**Subheading:** Where Dana Point comes to eat, drink, and stay awhile.

**CTA:** Reserve Your Table

---

## THE VIBE SECTION

### Not Your Typical Fine Dining

Forget stiff. Forget stuffy. Forget pretentious portions on plates the size of hubcaps.

Luxe is the kind of place where the martini hits perfectly, the steak is exactly how you ordered it, and the conversation flows because the atmosphere lets it.

Live music on weekends. A bar that knows your name. Food that actually fills you up.

**This is relaxed fine dining done right.**

---

## MENU HIGHLIGHTS

### The Menu

**Section intro:** Seafood. Steaks. Classic Italian. The kind of menu that makes deciding hard — in the best way.

*Show 3-4 signature dishes with brief, evocative descriptions. No full menu here — just the hooks.*

**CTA:** See Full Menu →

---

## THE MARTINI BAR

### The Bar

Our martini bar isn't an afterthought — it's the heartbeat of Luxe. Classic cocktails. Creative twists. Poured by people who give a damn.

Pull up a seat. Stay for one. Stay for three. We won't judge.

**CTA:** See Cocktail Menu →

---

## LIVE MUSIC

### Live Music Weekends

Every Friday and Saturday, we bring in live music that sets the mood without drowning out your date.

**CTA:** See Upcoming Artists →

---

## PRIVATE DINING TEASER

### Hosting Something Special?

We have semi-private spaces perfect for birthdays, anniversaries, or just because. Same kitchen. Same bar. A little more privacy.

**CTA:** Inquire About Private Dining →

# PART 4: THE CATERING JOURNEY

**CTA:** Start Planning

---

## THE PROMISE SECTION

### We Don't Just Cater. We Elevate.

For over 15 years, Luxe has been the secret weapon behind Dana Point's most memorable events. Weddings that actually felt like weddings. Corporate gatherings people didn't want to leave. Private parties that guests still talk about.

Same kitchen. Same obsessive attention to detail. Wherever you need us.

---

# PART 5: LANDING PAGES BY SEGMENT

---

## Corporate Event Catering

**URL:** /catering/corporate

### HERO

**Headline:** Corporate Catering That Actually Impresses

**Subheading:** Board meetings. Client dinners. Team celebrations. We make you look good.

### BODY COPY

Let's be honest: most corporate catering is forgettable. Lukewarm trays. Sad salads. That one vegetarian option no one asked for.

Luxe is different. We bring the same attention to your boardroom that we bring to our dining room. Every dish executed. Every detail considered. Every guest impressed.

Whether you're closing a deal over dinner or celebrating a quarter well-earned, we make the food the least of your worries — and the first thing people remember.

### SERVICES OFFERED

- Executive lunches and dinners
- Board meetings and investor events
- Team celebrations and company milestones
- Client appreciation events
- Product launches and private receptions
- Full-service staffing available

### CTA

**Button:** Get a Corporate Quote

## Wedding & Social Catering

**URL:** /catering/weddings

### HERO

**Headline:** Your Day. Done Differently.

**Subheading:** Wedding catering that feels like you — not a template.

### BODY COPY

Your wedding should taste like your wedding. Not like every other wedding. Not like what the catering company was already planning to make anyway.

At Luxe, we build your menu from scratch. Want your grandmother's recipe scaled for 150? Done. A station dedicated entirely to your partner's obsession with cheese? Obviously. A late-night taco bar because that's how you two met? We'll make it the highlight of the night.

We've been part of Dana Point weddings for over 15 years. We know what makes them memorable — and it's never the standard chicken-or-fish question.

### SERVICES OFFERED

- Fully customized menus
- Plated, family-style, or stations
- Cocktail hour passed appetizers
- Late-night bites
- Bar service and specialty cocktails
- Rehearsal dinners and bridal events
- Full-service staff

### CTA

**Button:** Start Planning Your Wedding

## Senior Living Enrichment Catering

**URL:** /catering/senior-living

### HERO

**Headline:** Dining That Enriches

**Subheading:** Elevating the everyday for senior living communities in Orange County.

### BODY COPY

For residents, mealtime is more than nutrition — it's connection, community, and one of the most anticipated parts of the day. It should feel like an event, not an obligation.

Luxe partners with senior living communities to create enrichment dining experiences that residents look forward to. Special occasion dinners. Holiday celebrations. Monthly fine dining nights that transform the dining room into something memorable.

Our team understands the unique needs of senior communities — dietary accommodations, presentation that sparks joy, and service that treats every resident like the guest of honor they are.

### SERVICES OFFERED

- Monthly fine dining enrichment programs
- Holiday celebration catering
- Family event meals
- Themed culinary experiences
- Dietary accommodation expertise
- White-glove service staff

### CTA

**Button:** Schedule a Community Tasting

---

## Private Party Catering

**URL:** /catering/private

### HERO

**Headline:** Your Party. Our Problem.

**Subheading:** From backyard birthdays to oceanfront galas — we handle it.

### BODY COPY

Throwing a party should be fun. The planning? That's where it gets stressful. Guest count panic. Menu paralysis. The realization that you own exactly six matching plates.

Hand it to us. Tell us the occasion, the vibe, and how many people you're trying to impress. We'll design a menu, bring the team, and make you look like the host you always wanted to be.

Birthdays. Anniversaries. Milestone moments. "Just because" celebrations. Whatever the reason, we'll give you a night worth remembering — without the dishes.

### SERVICES OFFERED

- In-home dinner parties
- Milestone celebrations (birthdays, anniversaries, graduations)
- Holiday gatherings
- Cocktail parties and receptions
- Full bar service available
- Drop-off or full-service options

### CTA

**Button:** Plan Your Party

---

# PART 6: MICROCOPY & UX WRITING

---

## Button Text

Buttons should feel like invitations, not commands.

- **Reservations:** Make a Reservation • Reserve Your Table • Book a Table
- **Catering Inquiry:** Get Your Custom Quote • Start Planning • Let's Talk
- **Menu:** See Full Menu • Explore the Menu
- **Contact:** Get in Touch • Reach Out • Say Hello
- **Avoid:** Submit • Click Here • Learn More (generic)

---

## Form Labels

Keep it conversational. Forms are conversations, not interrogations.

- "Your name" instead of "Full Name*"
- "Best email to reach you" instead of "Email Address*"
- "Phone (optional, but we respond faster)" instead of "Phone Number"
- "When's the big day?" instead of "Event Date*"
- "How many guests are we impressing?" instead of "Guest Count*"
- "Tell us about your event" instead of "Additional Details"
