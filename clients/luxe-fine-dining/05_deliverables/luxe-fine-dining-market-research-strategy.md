### B. AFFORDABLECATERINGORANGECOUNTY.COM - Strategic Rebrand Required

**New Brand Identity:**
- **Name:** Luxe Catering (synergy with Luxe Fine Dining) OR "Signature Events by Luxe" OR "Luxe Fine Catering"

**Luxe Fine Catering / Luxe Catering (New Brand):**
- Target: Weddings, galas, executive events, affluent private parties

- Marketing: WeddingWire, venue partnerships, Instagram, luxury positioning

**Benefits:**
