## A1: BRAND VOICE & TONE GUIDELINES

### The Luxe Personality

Upscale. Modern. Edgy. Sophisticated. This isn't your grandmother's fine dining experience — it's refined without being stuffy, elegant without being pretentious, and memorable without trying too hard.

### Voice Characteristics

- **Confident, not arrogant.** We know we're good. We don't need to oversell it.
- **Warm, not cheesy.** Hospitality runs deep, but we're not going to hug you at the door.
- **Playful, not gimmicky.** A wink, not a punchline.
- **Sophisticated, not stuffy.** Martinis and live music, not white tablecloths and silence.

### Words We Use
Elevated • Crafted • Curated • Unforgettable • Effortless • Exceptional • Iconic • Obsessed

### Words We Avoid
Journey (overused) • Synergy • Best-in-class • World-class • Revolutionary • Disrupt • Solutions

---

## A2: HOMEPAGE — THE GATEWAY

### HERO SECTION

**Headline:** The Luxe Dining Experience

**Subheading:** Fine Dining & Event Catering — with a twist.

*Visual:* Full-screen video or high-impact hero image. Moody lighting. Martini glass prominent.

*Interaction:* Martini glass click triggers reveal of the two paths below.

### THE REVEAL — TWO PATHS

**Left Container: The Restaurant**
- Headline: The Restaurant
- Supporting copy: The bar. The bites. The vibe.
- CTA: Make a Reservation

**Right Container: Private Events**
- Headline: Private Events
- Supporting copy: Your event. Our obsession.
- CTA: Plan Your Event

### SOCIAL PROOF STRIP

"Dana Point's destination for fine dining since 2010" • ★★★★★ 4.8 on Yelp • Featured in Orange Coast Magazine

### THE STORY SECTION

**More Than a Restaurant**

When Jimmy and Cindy opened Luxe in 2010, they had one rule: no ordinary nights. Every dish crafted. Every cocktail considered. Every guest remembered.

Fifteen years later, that obsession hasn't faded. Neither has the team — most of the staff has been here since day one.

---

## A3: THE RESTAURANT JOURNEY

### HERO

**Headline:** The Restaurant & Martini Bar

**Subheading:** Where Dana Point comes to eat, drink, and stay awhile.

### THE VIBE SECTION

**Not Your Typical Fine Dining**

Forget stiff. Forget stuffy. Forget pretentious portions on plates the size of hubcaps.

Luxe is the kind of place where the martini hits perfectly, the steak is exactly how you ordered it, and the conversation flows because the atmosphere lets it.

**This is relaxed fine dining done right.**

### MENU HIGHLIGHTS

Seafood. Steaks. Classic Italian. The kind of menu that makes deciding hard — in the best way.

CTA: See Full Menu →

### THE MARTINI BAR

Our martini bar isn't an afterthought — it's the heartbeat of Luxe. Classic cocktails. Creative twists. Poured by people who give a damn.

### LIVE MUSIC

Every Friday and Saturday, we bring in live music that sets the mood without drowning out your date.

---

## A4: THE CATERING JOURNEY (HUB PAGE)

### HERO

**Headline:** Private Event Catering

**Subheading:** Your event. Our obsession.

### THE PROMISE

**We Don't Just Cater. We Elevate.**

For over 15 years, Luxe has been the secret weapon behind Dana Point's most memorable events. Same kitchen. Same obsessive attention to detail. Wherever you need us.

### FOUR PATHS — CLICKABLE CARDS

- **Corporate Events** — "Impress the people who matter."
- **Weddings & Celebrations** — "Make it unforgettable."
- **Senior Living Enrichment** — "Elevate the everyday."
- **Private Parties** — "From intimate to extravagant."

### THE PROCESS

1. **Tell Us About Your Event** — Quick form, 24-hour response
2. **We Design Your Menu** — Custom-built for your vision
3. **We Deliver the Extraordinary** — Show up. Look good. Take all the credit.

---

## A5: CATERING LANDING PAGES

These are conversion machines. Each page has one job: make them call or fill out the form.

---

### CORPORATE EVENTS (/catering/corporate)

**HERO**

> **Your Next Corporate Event Should Be Unforgettable. Most Aren't.**

Subhead: We cater for companies who refuse to serve boxed lunches and call it "hospitality."

**THE PROBLEM**

Let's be real: most corporate catering is forgettable. Lukewarm chicken. Sad salads. That one vegetarian option no one touches.

Your team deserves better. Your clients definitely do.

**WHAT SETS US APART**

- **Chef-driven menus** — Not reheated trays from a warehouse
- **15 years in Dana Point** — We know what impresses this crowd
- **The Luxe Guarantee** — If they don't rave, your next event is on us

**CTA**

> **Stop settling. Start impressing.**

*Urgency:* "Your competitors are already booking their next client event."

---

### WEDDINGS (/catering/weddings)

**HERO**

> **Your Wedding Shouldn't Taste Like Everyone Else's.**

Subhead: Custom menus built from scratch. Because "chicken or fish" is not a personality.

**THE PROBLEM**

Most wedding caterers hand you a menu and say "pick three." That's not customization. That's a multiple choice test.

**HOW WE'RE DIFFERENT**

Want your grandmother's recipe scaled for 150? Done.

A late-night taco bar because that's how you two met? We'll make it the highlight of the night.

**THE GUARANTEE**

> **If your guests don't rave, your next anniversary dinner is on us.**

**SCARCITY**

We only accept 4 weddings per month. That's not marketing — it's math.

---

### SENIOR LIVING (/catering/senior-living)

**HERO**

> **Mealtimes Your Residents Actually Look Forward To.**

Subhead: Enrichment dining programs that elevate the everyday — and keep families coming back.

**THE OPPORTUNITY**

Dining is the #1 factor in resident satisfaction. Not the amenities. Not the activities. The food.

**THE BUSINESS CASE**

Communities with enrichment dining programs see higher occupancy, better reviews, and stronger family referrals. This isn't an expense — it's a competitive advantage.

---

### PRIVATE PARTIES (/catering/private)

**HERO**

> **Your Party. Our Problem.**

Subhead: From backyard birthdays to oceanfront galas — we handle it.

**THE PITCH**

Throwing a party should be fun. The planning? That's where it gets stressful.

Hand it to us. Tell us the occasion, the vibe, and how many people you're trying to impress. We'll make you look like the host you always wanted to be.

---

### 72-HOUR EMERGENCY (/catering/emergency)

**HERO**

> **Your Caterer Canceled. We Didn't.**

Subhead: 3 days. Any size. We'll make it happen.

**WHEN TO CALL**

- Your caterer just bailed
- An event got scheduled last-minute
- Someone "forgot" to book catering

**CTA**

> **Don't panic. Call Luxe.**

---

## A6: MICROCOPY & UX WRITING

### Button Text

- **Reservations:** Make a Reservation • Reserve Your Table
- **Catering:** Get Your Custom Quote • Start Planning • Let's Talk
- **Avoid:** Submit • Click Here • Learn More

### Form Labels (Conversational)

- "Your name" instead of "Full Name*"
- "When's the big day?" instead of "Event Date*"
- "How many guests are we impressing?" instead of "Guest Count*"

### Confirmation Messages

- **Catering Inquiry:** "We're on it. Expect to hear from us within 24 hours."
- **Reservation:** "You're in. We'll see you on [date] at [time]."

---

## A7: AWARD-WORTHY DESIGN SPECS

### Visual Identity

- **Photography:** Dark, moody, dramatic. Food lit like a perfume ad.
- **Video:** Hero video — slow-mo cocktail pour, steam rising, hands plating
- **Colors:** Black, charcoal, gold accents, crisp white text
- **Typography:** Serif headlines, sans-serif body

### Performance Standards

- PageSpeed Score: 90+ mobile
- Load time: Under 2 seconds
- Mobile-first design
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliant

## D4: DIY vs. MANAGED — WHAT'S THE REAL DIFFERENCE?

---

### DIY = We Build It, You Run It

You get everything listed above. We build it, train you, hand it off. Then you're on your own.

**DIY is right for you if:**
- You have 5-10 hours/week to manage and optimize these systems
- You're comfortable in Airtable, n8n, Brevo, and Netlify
- You can write and A/B test your own email sequences
- You can build new lead magnets when the current ones get stale
- You can troubleshoot when something breaks
- You don't need strategic guidance — just the tools

**What DIY does NOT include:**
- ❌ Ongoing SEO monitoring (initial setup only, then you're on your own)
- ❌ Keyword tracking and ranking reports
- ❌ Ongoing optimization (that's on you)
- ❌ New lead magnets (you create them)
- ❌ A/B testing subject lines, landing pages, CTAs
- ❌ Outreach list refreshes (lists go stale in 90 days)
- ❌ AI voice script refinement based on call data
- ❌ Quarterly strategy sessions
- ❌ Priority support (email only, 48-72 hour response)
- ❌ Performance reporting and recommendations
- ❌ Someone watching the data and telling you what to fix
- ❌ Permanent portal access (90 days only)

**Reality check:** Most DIY clients don't touch the system after 60 days. It just sits there.

---

### MANAGED = We Build It AND Grow It For You

Same build. But we don't disappear. We actively work on your systems every month — optimizing, testing, improving, and growing.

**What's included with Managed:**

|-------------------|---------------|
| ✅ Deep dive market research | Delivered upfront — you keep this no matter what |
| ✅ SEO & keyword tracking | We monitor rankings and optimize monthly |
| ✅ Client portal (permanent) | Live dashboard with KPIs, not just project tracking |
| ✅ Monthly optimization | We're in the system every week tweaking what's working |
| ✅ New lead magnets quarterly | Fresh content so your funnel doesn't go stale |
| ✅ A/B testing | Subject lines, CTAs, landing pages — always improving |
| ✅ Outreach list refreshes | New prospects every 90 days |
| ✅ AI voice script refinement | We listen to calls and improve the scripts |
| ✅ Quarterly strategy calls | 30-min call to review data and plan next quarter |
| ✅ Priority support | Same-day response, we fix it fast |
| ✅ Monthly performance report | What's working, what's not, what we're doing about it |
| ✅ Proactive recommendations | We tell you what to do next based on data |

**The real value:** You focus on running the restaurant. We focus on filling it.

## D6: THE REAL QUESTION

**DIY ($14,500 one-time):**
You pay more upfront. You own everything. You run everything. You optimize everything. You troubleshoot everything. If it breaks at 10pm on a Saturday, that's your problem.

Most DIY clients are excited for 60 days. Then life gets busy. The system sits untouched. Leads slow down. Nobody's watching the data.

**Managed ($7,000 setup + $1,497/mo):**
You pay less upfront. We run it. We optimize it. We grow it. You get monthly reports showing exactly what's working. We tell you what to do next. If it breaks at 10pm on a Saturday, we fix it.

**The math:**
- One wedding = $8,000 - $15,000
- One corporate client = $3,000 - $10,000
- One senior living contract = $5,000 - $20,000/month

The managed fee pays for itself with ONE new client per month. Everything after that is profit.
