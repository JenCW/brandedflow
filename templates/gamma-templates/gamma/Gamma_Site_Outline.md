### Section 2: The Problem (Empathy)

**Headline:**
"You Didn't Start Your Business to Become a Marketing Expert"

**3 Pain Points (icons + short text):**

1. **Confusing Tools That Don't Talk**
   You've got 10 different tools that don't work together. Leads fall through cracks. Nothing's automated.

2. **Can't Figure Out AI & Automation**
   Everyone says "use AI" but nobody explains HOW. You don't have time or money to figure it out yourself.

3. **Tired of Marketing BS**
   Condescending "rules," confusing jargon, and people trying to sell you stuff you don't need.

**Text:**
Sound familiar? You're not alone. That's exactly why we built Branded + Flow.

---

### Section 3: The Solution

**Headline:**
"We Build Systems Where Everything Works Together"

**3 Parts (visual + text):**

1. **Brand That Shines**
   Professional look that builds trust and makes you proud to share

2. **Automations That Run in the Background**
   Lead capture, follow-ups, scheduling - no manual work

3. **AI That Works 24/7**
   Receptionist answering calls, qualifying leads, booking appointments

**Text:**
Not just a pretty website. Not just automation. Not just AI.
**Everything connected. Everything working for you.**

## Page 3: ABOUT

### Section 1: Hero

**Headline:**
"Hi, I'm Jen"

**Subheadline:**
I lost everything to COVID. I'm rebuilding at 50 with 4 kids and no safety net. I built Branded + Flow to help other people rebuilding too.

**Image:** Your photo (professional but approachable)

---

### Section 2: The Story

**Text (from Master Brand Guide):**

I lost everything to COVID.

My business shut down overnight. No savings. No Plan B. Just me, my husband, and our 4 kids trying to figure out how to survive.

We've been living with my mom for 2 years now. Sleeping on a futon in her office alcove. My sons on the couch. Not exactly the American Dream.

I'm 50. I'm supposed to have it figured out by now.

But I'm also a hard worker. I'm smart. And I'm not giving up.

So I'm rebuilding. From nothing. Again.

**Why I Built Branded + Flow:**

I know what it's like to be overwhelmed. To piece together tools that don't work. To feel stupid because you can't figure out "AI and automation" and everyone acts like it's so obvious.

I know what it's like to hate sales calls. To feel anxious about marketing. To just want to do the work you love without all the BS.

So I built Branded + Flow for people like me. People rebuilding. People overwhelmed. People who need systems that just WORK.

**No jargon. No BS. No confusing marketing rules.**

Just systems that make your business look professional and work automatically so you can focus on what you actually do.

---

### Section 3: How I Work

**Headline:**
"How I'm Different"

**3 Points:**

1. **Plain English, No BS**
   I don't talk down to you or use confusing jargon. If I use a technical term, I explain it.

2. **No Phone Calls Required**
   I have phone anxiety (it's a disability thing, not just a preference). So I built a business that works entirely via email and text. You'll never have to get on a call with me.

3. **You Own Everything**
   No vendor lock-in. No proprietary systems. Everything I build, you own. If you want to walk away and run it yourself, you can.

---

### Section 4: CTA

**Headline:**
"Let's Build Something Together"

**Text:**
Tell me what's broken in your business. I'll send you a proposal with clear pricing and timeline. No sales pitch. No phone calls. Just yes or no.

"Get Started" (links to Contact page)
