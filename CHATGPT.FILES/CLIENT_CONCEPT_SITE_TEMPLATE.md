# [CLIENT NAME] – 4-Page Gamma Concept Site

Business: [Business name / URL]  
Contact: [Name, email, how you met]  
Date: [Today’s date]

---

## PAGE 1 – MODERN HOMEPAGE MOCKUP

**Goal:** Give them a clean, modern, “oh damn this is what it *could* be” homepage.

### 1.1 Hero Section

- Headline (plain-speak, no fluff):  
  > [One-sentence “what you do” for [ICP].]  
  Example: “AI reception for business owners who hate answering the phone.”

- Subhead (who it’s for + outcome):  
  > [Who it’s for] + [what result they get without pain]  
  Example: “Run a real business without ever picking up another unknown number.”

- Primary CTA:  
  - [Button text]: “See how it works” / “Start my demo” / “Get my AI receptionist”

### 1.2 “What You Actually Do”

- 3 bullets or 3-step strip:
  1. [Step 1 – what user does]
  2. [Step 2 – what the system does]
  3. [Step 3 – result]

Example:  

1. Your callers ring your business.  
2. Our AI receptionist answers, qualifies, and collects details.  
3. You get clean, organized leads without touching the phone.

### 1.3 Benefits Section

- 3–5 bullets, all outcomes, no jargon:  
  - [Benefit 1]  
  - [Benefit 2]  
  - [Benefit 3]  
  - [Benefit 4]

### 1.4 Social Proof Placeholder

- “Trusted by [type of client] in [location/industry]”  
- Logos / mock logos or “Client stories coming soon.”

## PAGE 2 – AI-OPTIMIZED COPY CONCEPTS

**Goal:** Show them how their message can be structured for AI + modern search, not old-school SEO.

### 2.1 Core Sections + Headings

Use clear H2/H3s AI agents can parse easily:

- H2: What Is [Product/Service]?  
  Short paragraph in plain-speak.

- H2: Who Is This For?  
  Bullets for main ICPs.

- H2: Problems We Solve  
  Bullet list of “You’re probably dealing with…” pain points.

- H2: How [Product] Works in 3 Steps  
  Reuse the 3-step from Page 1, but spelled out more.

- H2: Results You Can Expect  
  List outcomes: more leads, fewer missed calls, less anxiety, etc.

- H2: Common Questions (Mini FAQ)  
  - Q1: [Top objection]  
  - Q2: [Second objection]  
  - Q3: [Risk/commitment question]

### 2.2 AI-Optimization Notes (for them)

Add a small explainer block:

> This structure is “AI-optimized” because:
>
> - Headings are clear and descriptive  
> - Questions and answers are explicit  
> - Use cases are spelled out in simple language  
> - Content is easy for AI agents and modern search to interpret and route

## PAGE 3 – LEAD MAGNET + INTAKE FLOW

**Goal:** Show how people go from “curious” → “in the system” without manual chasing.

### 3.1 Lead Magnet Concept

- Title:  
  > “[Short, useful thing] for [ICP]”

Examples:  

- “The No-Phone-Call Playbook for Solo Providers”  
- “5 Client Scripts Your AI Receptionist Can Use Day One”  

- Promise:  
  > “In this, you’ll get [3–5 bullets of value].”

### 3.2 Intake Flow

Describe visually how it works:

1. Visitor clicks “Get the [lead magnet]”  
2. Gamma page shows a simple form:  
   - Name  
   - Email  
   - Business type  
   - Biggest current problem  
3. On submit:
   - They get the lead magnet (email or direct download)  
   - A lead record is created in Airtable (or whatever CRM)  
   - A follow-up sequence starts (2–3 emails)  

Include a diagram block if useful:

> VISITOR → Lead Magnet Page → Form →  
> Airtable Lead → Follow-Up Emails → Optional Call/Signup

## PAGE 4 – HOW AUTOMATION TIES IN (THE SYSTEM)

**Goal:** Make it obvious this isn’t just “a pretty site” – it’s a working system.

### 4.1 System Overview

Explain in 4 bullets:

- Gamma page = **front door** (website/intake)  
- Airtable = **brain/CRM** (where all leads live)  
- n8n = **automation engine** (moves data + sends follow-ups)  
- [Their product, e.g. AI receptionist] = the **frontline worker**

### 4.2 Basic Automation Flows

List **2–3 core automation flows** in plain language:

1. **New Lead from Site → CRM + Email #1**  
   - When someone fills out the form, they get a welcome email + you get a clean record.

2. **AI Receptionist → CRM Update**  
   - When the AI takes a call, the transcript/summary gets pushed into the same lead record.

3. **Stage Change → Follow-Up**  
   - When you move someone to “Interested” or “Hot” in Airtable, a short follow-up sequence goes out automatically.

### 4.3 Why This Matters (for them)

Add 3 bullets:

- You stop bleeding leads.  
- You don’t rely on memory or sticky notes.  
- You look professional without hiring staff.

# OUTREACH MESSAGE TEMPLATE

Use this once the concept is built (or 70% built).

## Short DM / Text / Email Version

> Hey [Name] —  
> I mocked up a modern, AI-optimized concept for your updated website and how it could tie into an automated intake + follow-up system.  
>
> If you want to see it, I’ll send you the Gamma link.

That’s it. No selling. No pitch. Let them ask.

## If They Say “Yes, send it”

Reply:

> Awesome, here it is: [Gamma link]  
>
> This is just a concept, but it shows:
>
> - a cleaner homepage  
> - clearer messaging for AI + modern search  
> - how a simple intake + automation flow could work behind the scenes  
>  
> If you like the direction, I can turn this into a full build and wire up the automations for you.
