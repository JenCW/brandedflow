# DIRECTIVE: [Task Name]

## 1. GOAL
[What this task accomplishes - be specific about the end result]

## 2. INPUTS
- **Location**: [Where inputs come from - file paths, folders, etc.]
- **Format**: [File types, data structures, formats]
- **Required**: [What must exist before running - prerequisites]
- **Optional**: [What's nice to have but not required]

## 3. PROCESS

### Phase 1: Orchestration (Decision Making)
1. **Check for existing directive** (if applicable - this directive should already exist)
2. **For coding/development work:**
   - Create detailed blueprint with:
     * Objectives: Clear goals and expected outcomes
     * Proposed Changes: Specific files and modifications
     * Logic/Edge Cases: All scenarios to handle
     * FE/BE Separation: Clear frontend/backend boundaries
     * Dependencies: Required libraries, services, or data
   - **WAIT FOR EXPLICIT HUMAN APPROVAL** before proceeding to execution
3. **For deterministic work:**
   - Use existing execution scripts/MCPs
   - Call scripts in correct order as specified below
4. **Handle errors and self-anneal:**
   - When errors occur: Fix script → Test → Update this directive with learnings
   - When improvements discovered: Update directive with new constraints/approaches
   - Document fixes in workflow_state.md or this directive's "Learnings" section

### Phase 2: Execution
1. **If blueprint approved:** Implement according to approved blueprint
2. **If using scripts:** Execute deterministic scripts/MCPs in order:
   - [List script execution order here]
3. **Verify outputs** match expected results
4. **Self-anneal:** Update directive with any learnings from execution

## 4. OUTPUTS
- [What gets created/changed - be specific]
- [Where outputs go - file paths, locations]
- [Format of outputs - file types, structures]
- [How to verify outputs are correct]

## 5. EXECUTION SCRIPTS
- `execution/[script-name].py` - [What it does, when to use it]
- `execution/[script-name].sh` - [What it does, when to use it]
- [List all scripts that should be used for this task]

## 6. EDGE CASES
- [Known issues or special conditions]
- [Error handling approach]
- [API limits or constraints]
- [What to do when prerequisites are missing]
- [Common failure points and how to handle them]

## 7. LEARNINGS
- [Things discovered during execution]
- [Improvements made over time]
- [Common errors and fixes]
- [Optimizations found]
- [What works well, what doesn't]
