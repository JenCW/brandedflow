# DIRECTIVE: Create Client Proposal

## 1. GOAL
Create and send a conversion-focused, personalized proposal that gets clients to say yes. This directive covers both proposal creation and delivery to the client.

## When to Use
- Client needs a proposal for services
- Client is cost-conscious and needs to see value
- Client needs to understand ROI before investing
- You want to demonstrate expertise and build trust

## Key Principles (DO NOT DEVIATE)

### 1. NEVER Start with Price
- Start with their story, their pain, their opportunity
- Price comes at the END, after value is established
- Make price feel like a natural investment decision, not a sales pitch

### 2. Use Simple, Jargon-Free Language
- Write like you're talking to a friend, not a tech expert
- No "CRM integration" - say "a simple system that tracks everything"
- No "lead magnets" - say "professional menu PDFs"
- No "automation sequences" - say "emails that send themselves"
- If a restaurant owner can't understand it, rewrite it

### 3. Show, Don't Tell
- Don't just list features - explain what happens step by step
- Show the automation process: "Step 1: AI answers... Step 2: AI asks..."
- Include actual website copy they'll see
- Show the math: "One wedding = $8,000-15,000"

### 4. Elegant, Modern Design
- Dark, sophisticated color scheme (black, gold accents)
- Elegant typography (serif for headlines, clean sans-serif for body)
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Table of contents with smooth scroll navigation
- Professional but not stuffy

### 5. Phased Approach for Cost-Conscious Clients
- Break into 3 phases
- Phase 1 proves value (lowest risk entry)
- Each phase builds on previous success
- Same total investment if they do all phases
- They decide when to move forward

### 6. Include Everything
- Market research & competitive analysis (deliverable)
- Target market & niche identification (deliverable)
- Client portal access (deliverable)
- Website execution copy (what they'll actually see)
- Automation processes (how they actually work)
- Lead magnet details (what they are, why they work)
- ROI calculations (the math)
- Payment terms (clear and simple)

## Content Guidelines

### Language Rules
- ✅ Use: "An AI that answers your phone" 
- ❌ Avoid: "AI Voice Concierge"

- ✅ Use: "A simple system that tracks everything"
- ❌ Avoid: "CRM integration"

- ✅ Use: "Professional menu PDFs"
- ❌ Avoid: "Lead magnets"

- ✅ Use: "Emails that send themselves"

- ❌ Avoid: "Analytics dashboard"

### Math/ROI Format
Always show:
- What one client/event is worth
- How monthly fee compares
- Break-even analysis
- Example: "$697/month pays for itself with ONE new client per month"

### Automation Process Format
Use step-by-step format:
- Step 1: [What happens]

Make it visual and easy to follow.
