# Context File Automation - Simple Guide

## 🚀 Quick Start

**Just run this one command:**
```bash
./automation-system/update_and_open.sh
```

That's it! It checks your files and opens a dashboard.

## 🎯 What It Does

Keeps your important files updated:
- **CONTEXT.md** - Your main "start here" file
- **CLIENT_STATUS.md** - Who your clients are
- **DECISIONS_LOG.md** - What you decided

The dashboard shows you what needs attention.

## 📋 When to Use

**Every morning:** Run it to see what needs attention

**Before committing:** Run it to make sure CONTEXT.md is updated

**When you make changes:** Run it to see if other files need updating

## 📁 What's Inside (You Don't Need to Know This)

- `update_and_open.sh` - The one script you need
- `context_manager.py` - Does the checking (you don't run this directly)
- `context_dashboard.html` - The pretty dashboard (opens automatically)
- `status.json` - Data file (created automatically)

---

## 💡 That's It!

Just run: `./automation-system/update_and_open.sh`

Everything else happens automatically.
