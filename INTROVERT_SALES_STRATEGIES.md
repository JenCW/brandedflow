### Stage 3: DISCOVERY (Understanding Their Needs)

**When they're ready to explore working together:**

#### Async Discovery First
**Before any call, send a detailed questionnaire:**
- What's your biggest challenge right now?
- What have you tried before?
- What does success look like for you?
- What's your timeline and budget range?
- What questions do you have for me?

**Why this works:**
- You get thoughtful answers (not rushed call responses)

- Filters out tire-kickers
- Shows you're organized and professional
- Reduces anxiety because you know what to expect

#### Video Call (If Necessary)
**Make it on YOUR terms:**

**Before the call:**
- Set expectations: "I'll walk you through examples and answer your questions"
- Limit to 30 minutes max
- Use Zoom/Google Meet (can hide self-view if that helps)
- Have agenda/script ready
- Screen share = less eye contact pressure

**During the call:**
- Start with: "I reviewed your questionnaire, let me show you what I'm thinking..."
- Screen share your ideas/examples
- Lots of listening, less talking
- Take notes
- "Let me think about that and email you details"

**After the call:**
- Detailed email recap (your strength!)
- Proposal in writing (beautiful document)
- Clear next steps
- They can decide without phone pressure

### Stage 4: PROPOSAL (Making the Offer)

**All in writing - your zone of genius:**

**Create FAQ document addressing common concerns:**
- ROI expectations
- What happens if...
- How we'll communicate
- Success stories
- Guarantee/assurance

---

### Stage 5: CLOSING (Getting to Yes)

**Still no phone required:**

#### Text-Based Close
**Email or text conversation:**
```
"Hey [Name], did you have a chance to review the proposal?
What questions can I answer?"

[Their response]

"That makes total sense. Here's how we handle that..."

"Want to move forward? I can send the agreement via email -
you'll e-sign and we'll schedule our kickoff via Zoom."
```

#### Use Agreements/Contracts with E-Signature
- HelloSign, DocuSign, PandaDoc
- All handled online

- No phone calls needed

### 3. Speaking & Workshops
**But make them YOUR way:**

- **YouTube tutorials** (record solo, edit later)

### 4. Community Building
**Create YOUR space where people come:**
- LinkedIn newsletter with engaged readers
- Facebook group for your niche

- Slack group for past clients
- In-person meetup at Colab Space (controlled environment)

### 5. Inbound Marketing Automation
**Set up systems that qualify leads for you:**

**Landing Pages with:**
- Quiz or assessment ("Is your brand hurting your business?")
- Calculator ("How much should you spend on automation?")
- Lead magnet (guide, template, checklist)
- Automated follow-up sequences

**Chatbot on Website:**

## HANDLING YOUR PTSD WITH PHONE CALLS

### Be Honest About Your Boundaries
**On your website/materials:**
- "I do my best work in written communication"
- "Book a video call after initial questionnaire"
- "Text or email for fastest response"

### Create Phone Call Protocol (When Unavoidable)
1. **Only scheduled** (never random/unexpected)
2. **Clear agenda** sent beforehand
3. **Time limit** (30 min max)
4. **You can say**: "Let me follow up via email with details"
5. **Record calls** (with permission) = can review later
6. **Have someone else** handle intake calls initially

### Use Your Story
**Your authenticity is powerful:**
- "I'm a better listener in writing than on the phone"
- "I provide more thoughtful responses via email"
- "Let's start with a questionnaire so I can give you my best thinking"

**Clients who value you will respect this. Clients who don't aren't your ideal clients anyway.**

## SCRIPTS FOR COMMON SITUATIONS

### When Someone Asks to Hop on a Call

**Instead of:**
❌ "Sure!" (then dread and anxiety)

**Try:**
✅ "I'd love to help! I find I give better value when I can review your situation first. Can you fill out this quick questionnaire? Then I'll send you a video with my initial thoughts, and we can schedule a call if you'd like."

### When Someone Calls Unexpectedly

**Voice message greeting:**
"Hi! You've reached Jen at Branded + Flow. I'm focused on client work right now. For fastest response, text me at [number] or email [email]. If you'd like to schedule a call, use my calendar link: [link]. Thanks!"

### When Following Up on a Proposal

**Email template:**
```
Subject: Thoughts on [Company Name] branding + automation?

Hey [Name],

Hope you had a chance to review the proposal I sent over on [date].

I've been thinking about [specific thing from their questionnaire],
and I have a few ideas on how we could [specific solution].

Any questions I can answer?

Happy to jump on a quick Zoom if you'd like to talk through
anything, or we can keep chatting via email - whatever works
best for you.

- Jen

P.S. [Relevant case study or resource link]
