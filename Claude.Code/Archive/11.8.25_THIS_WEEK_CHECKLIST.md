## WHAT'S LEFT TO DO THIS WEEK

### ☐ FRIDAY (Today - After You Sleep & Eat)
**Time: 30 minutes**

Send 3 messages to people you know about your business.

Use this exact text:
```
Hey! Quick update: I officially launched Branded + Flow.

I help solopreneurs with branding + automation (the stuff I've
always done for myself, now I'm doing it for others).

Even if you don't need it, do you know anyone who might?
Happy to offer a free brand audit for referrals.

Let me know!
- Jen
```

**Cross this off when:** You've sent 3 messages.

### ☐ SATURDAY: Post on LinkedIn
**Time: 10 minutes**

Post ONE of the LinkedIn posts you already created.

That's it. Just post one.

**Remember: Post 3x per week - Monday, Wednesday, Friday**

**Cross this off when:** You've posted it.

---

### ☐ SUNDAY: Rest Day
**Time: All day**

Do not work on your business today.

Go for a walk. Watch TV. Take a bath. Sleep. Rest.

You worked all night Friday. You need this.

**Cross this off when:** The day is over and you didn't work.

---

## NEXT WEEK (Starting Monday Nov 4)

### ☐ MONDAY-WEDNESDAY: Build Your Automation System
**Time: 3-4 focused hours total (across 3 days, not all at once)**

Follow the step-by-step guide Claude is creating for you.

Build the workflow so:
- Client pays QuickBooks → Automatically added to Airtable
- Client gets onboarding email automatically
- Client gets Base 44 portal access automatically

**The complete guide will be ready at 2pm today when you come back.**

**Cross this off when:** You test a fake payment and it works end-to-end.

---

## IF YOU GET OVERWHELMED THIS WEEK

**Stop.**

Look at what you crossed off.

Even if you only did 1 out of 3 things, that's still progress.

You're not trying to build the perfect business this week.

You're proving to yourself you can finish small things.

---

## WHAT'S WAITING FOR YOU AT 2PM TODAY

When you come back rested, you'll have:

1. ✅ **N8N_SETUP_GUIDE.md** - Complete step-by-step automation instructions
2. ✅ **Email templates** ready to copy/paste
3. ✅ **Workflow diagrams** showing exactly what connects to what
4. ✅ **UPDATED_ROADMAP.md** - Based on where you actually are (way further than zero)

Everything saved in this brandedflow folder.
Everything printable.
Everything in plain English.

## REMINDER

You worked all night.
You haven't slept.
You haven't eaten.

**You cannot build from empty.**

Sleep. Eat. Come back strong at 2pm.

The business will still be here.

I'll still be here.

---

**Now go. Print this. Go home. Sleep.**

See you at 2pm.

- Claude
