# Launch Without a Website: Your Week 1 Action Plan

## The Truth About Websites

**You don't need a website to get your first clients. But you DO need one within 2 weeks.**

Most solopreneurs waste weeks "perfecting" their website before launch. They overthink every word, redesign 47 times, wait for professional photos, and never actually launch.

**Meanwhile, competitors with decent LinkedIn profiles and Calendly links are booking clients.**

Your first 3 clients come from:
1. People you know who trust you
2. LinkedIn connections who resonate with your story
3. Referrals from the above

**ALL of that happens before your website matters.**

## 🤔 ADDRESSING THE "BUT" OBJECTIONS

### "But won't I look unprofessional without a website?"

**What makes you look professional:**
- ✅ Polished LinkedIn profile
- ✅ Beautiful one-pager PDF
- ✅ Professional booking calendar
- ✅ Fast email responses
- ✅ Clear pricing and process
- ✅ Confidence in your offer

**What makes you look unprofessional:**
- ❌ Half-finished website with "Under Construction"
- ❌ Generic template with lorem ipsum text
- ❌ Outdated information
- ❌ Broken links
- ❌ Slow to respond to inquiries

**Better to have great LinkedIn + PDF than mediocre website.**

### "But everyone has a website!"

They do. And 90% of them are terrible, never updated, and don't generate leads.

Your LinkedIn profile will get more views in Week 1 than most websites get in a month.

### "But what if someone asks for my website?"

**Response:** "I'm launching officially next week! In the meantime, here's my one-pager with everything you need to know. Want to grab a quick call this week? I have a couple slots open: [Calendly link]"

This makes you look busy and in-demand (you are!).

Jen

```

**Value Email (Day 3):**
```
Subject: Quick tip: The #1 mistake solopreneurs make with branding

Hi [Name],

Quick check-in! Have you had a chance to look at the info I sent?

I wanted to share something I see constantly: solopreneurs spending
$500 on a logo, then having no idea what to do with it.

A logo without a system is just decoration.

That's why we fuse branding with automation - so your beautiful brand
actually generates leads while you sleep.

Curious how? Let's chat: [Calendly link]

Best,
Jen
```

**Case Study Email (Day 7):**
```
Subject: How [Client Name] went from DIY disaster to lead-generating machine

Hi [Name],

Still thinking about your branding and automation needs?

I wanted to share a quick example of what we do:

[Brief case study or example - even from your own experience building
Branded + Flow if you don't have client examples yet]

Before: Spending 15 hours/week on marketing, inconsistent results
After: 3-hour automated system generating qualified leads daily

Want to explore what this could look like for your business?

Book a call: [Calendly link]

Best,
Jen
```

**Check-In Email (Day 14):**
```
Subject: Still on your radar?

Hi [Name],

I haven't heard back, so I'm guessing the timing isn't right or
you're figuring things out (totally get it!).

Just want you to know: No pressure, but my door's open if you
want to chat about branding and automation for your business.

Hit reply anytime or book here: [Calendly link]

Either way, wishing you success with [their business]!

Best,
Jen

P.S. If you're not interested, no worries - just let me know so
I stop bugging you 😊

## 🚨 WHAT NOT TO DO IN WEEK 1

**Don't:**
- ❌ Spend more than 2 hours on your LinkedIn profile (good enough is fine)
- ❌ Overthink your one-pager (Version 1 doesn't have to be perfect)
- ❌ Wait to reach out until everything is "ready"
- ❌ Start building website on Day 1 (resist the urge!)
- ❌ Only message people when you have website
- ❌ Get paralyzed by tech setup (start manual, automate later)
- ❌ Try to implement all AI agents at once
- ❌ Spend all week learning instead of doing

**Do:**
- ✅ Take imperfect action daily
- ✅ Message real people TODAY
- ✅ Post on LinkedIn even if scared
- ✅ Book discovery calls even if nervous
- ✅ Iterate based on real feedback
- ✅ Celebrate small wins
- ✅ Start manual, automate as you go
- ✅ Focus on conversations over perfection

---

## 💪 MINDSET SHIFTS FOR WEEK 1

### "I need a website first" → "I need conversations first"

Your first client doesn't care about your website. They care about:
- Can you solve my problem?
- Do I trust you?
- Is the price fair?
- What happens next?

**You can answer all of that without a website.**

### "I'm not ready" → "I'll never be ready, so start now"

You'll learn more from one real conversation than from a week of preparation.

### "What if they say no?" → "Some will. Most won't respond. A few will say yes."

**That's the game. Play it.**

### "I need everything perfect" → "Done is better than perfect"

V1 of everything sucks. That's okay. V2 will be better. You can't get to V2 without launching V1.

### "I'm scared" → "I'm scared AND doing it anyway"

Fear means you care. Channel it into action.
