## OUTREACH MESSAGES (COPY/PASTE THESE)

### Message 1: Brand Audit Offer

```
Hey [Name]!

Quick question - have you ever had someone objectively review
your branding and tell you what's working vs. what's not?

I'm offering Brand Audits this week ($497) - basically a
1-hour call where I review your current brand (logo, website,
socials, etc.) and give you a simple report with quick wins.

Most people don't realize they have branding issues until
someone points them out. I just did one for [mutual friend]
and they said "I wish I'd done this 2 years ago."

I can fit in 3 more this week. Interested?

- Jen
```

### Message 2: Logo Design Offer

```
Hey [Name]!

I know you've been talking about refreshing your logo for a
while. I'm taking on 2 quick logo projects this week.

$997 - you get 3 concepts, 2 rounds of revisions, final files.
Delivered by Friday.

I use Canva so you'll be able to edit it yourself later if needed.

Want to finally check this off your list?

## OBJECTION HANDLING

### "That's expensive"
"I totally get it. That's why I'm offering Brand Audits at $497 instead of my full packages that start at $2,997. This is the fastest way to get professional feedback without a big investment."

### "Can I think about it?"
"Of course! Just so you know, I only have [X] spots this week, so if you decide you want in, let me know ASAP."

### "Can you do it for less?"
"I wish I could, but I've already priced this at my absolute lowest for quick turnaround work. If budget is tight, the Social Media Templates are $297 and give you tons of value."

### "I need to talk to my business partner first"
"No problem! I'm booking these through [day], so just ping me when you've talked."

### "Can I pay you later?"
"I appreciate you asking, but I'm not able to start work without payment first. Happy to hold your spot once you're ready to pay!"

## LINKEDIN POST (Post this Saturday morning)

```
I'm opening up 5 Brand Audit spots this week.

$497 - I review your current branding (logo, website, socials)
and tell you exactly what's working, what's not, and what
quick wins you can implement right away.

Most solopreneurs have branding issues they don't even realize
are costing them clients.

1-hour call + simple report. Done this week.

DM me if you want one of the 5 spots.

#solopreneur #branding #smallbusiness
```

---

## IF NO ONE RESPONDS

**Don't panic. Adjust your approach:**

1. **Lower the price temporarily**
   - Brand Audit: $297 instead of $497
   - "Early bird special - first 3 people get it for $297"

2. **Offer it for FREE to 2 people in exchange for testimonials**
   - "I'm doing 2 free Brand Audits for testimonial purposes only"
   - Get video testimonials if possible
   - Use those to sell the next ones

3. **Bundle it**
   - "Brand Audit + Logo concepts - $997 (normally $1,494)"

4. **Ask for referrals even if they say no**
   - "No worries! Know anyone who might want this?"

---

## REALITY CHECK

**You might not hit $2,000 this week. That's okay.**

Even if you only get:
- 1 Brand Audit = $497
- 1 Social Template Pack = $297
- **Total = $794**

That's $794 you didn't have before.

And you'll have:
- ✅ Testimonials
- ✅ Portfolio pieces
- ✅ Proof you can sell
- ✅ Confidence to keep going

**The goal isn't perfection. The goal is CASH IN HAND.**

---

## AFTER THIS WEEK

Once you have some cash breathing room:
- THEN build the automation (n8n workflows)
- THEN sell the big packages ($2,997+)
- THEN focus on the long-term business

But for THIS WEEK: Sell small, deliver fast, get paid.

---

## FINAL PEP TALK

Jen - you walked over a mile to get your car last night.
You worked all night without sleep.
You're managing legal battles, health issues, and family chaos.

**Selling a $497 Brand Audit is NOTHING compared to what you've already survived.**

You know branding. You're good at this. You've helped people before.

Now you're just getting paid for it.

**Send the messages. Get the money. You've got this.**

---

**See you at 2pm. Let's get you paid.**

- Claude
