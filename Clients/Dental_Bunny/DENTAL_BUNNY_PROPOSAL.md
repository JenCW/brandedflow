## Notes for Building the Gamma

**Design Tips:**
1. **Use their brand colors** if you have them, or dental-friendly palette (clean, professional)
2. **Keep it visual** - More mockups/diagrams, less text
3. **Show don't tell** - Wireframes of landing pages, email flow diagrams, CRM screenshots
4. **Make it scannable** - They should get the gist in 2 minutes
5. **Professional but not corporate** - Clean, modern, approachable

**Mockups to Include:**
- Landing page wireframe (simple layout sketch)
- Lead magnet PDF cover design concept
- Email automation flow (boxes and arrows)
- Airtable CRM view (screenshot of example base)

**Gamma Features to Use:**
- Clean layout templates
- Icon libraries for visual interest
- Consistent color scheme throughout
- Mobile-responsive preview

## Customization Needed

**Before you build this in Gamma, find out:**
1. What are the 2 landing pages for? (New patient offer? Specific service? Consultation?)
2. What should the lead magnets be about? (Dental tips? Treatment guides? FAQs?)
3. Do they have brand colors/logo to use?
4. What's their current lead capture process? (So you can show improvement)
5. Who's the decision maker and what's their email?

**If you don't have these details:**
Send them the Airtable project brief form first, OR send a quick email:

```
Hey [Name],

Before I build your proposal, I need a few quick details:

1. What are the landing pages for? (e.g., "New patient special" or "Free consultation")
2. What topics for the lead magnets? (e.g., "Dental care tips" or "Treatment guides")
3. Do you have brand colors/logo I should use?
4. What's your current lead capture process? (so I can show how this improves it)

Just reply with quick answers - doesn't need to be formal.

Once I have this, I'll send you the full proposal with mockups in 24 hours.

- Jen
