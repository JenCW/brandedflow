Aqr Website
AQR Website — Project Log
What This File Is

A running, living recap of everything we’ve done, are doing, and still need to do for the AQR website inside this chat. This replaces the need to hunt back through messages.

It will grow as we go.

1. Project Goal

Client wants the new AQ Remodeling site to look very close to <https://aqremodeling.com> but not a clone — same structure, same high‑end feel, but with your spin, cleaner layout, better spacing, better UX, more modern polish.

You built their version from scratch in 10Web + Elementor, and now we’re refining it.

2. Work Completed (So Far)

Built full site structure to match reference site

Implemented hero slider using template slides

Added nav bar over hero image

Moved logo + socials into hero area

Adjusted structure panel visibility and worked through UI confusion

Uploaded new images into Media Library

Set up Custom CSS in WP Customizer and applied global typography + spacing fixes

Adjusted section padding, grid spacing, card padding

Fixed project grid issues (images breaking, spacing, margins)

Synced most major layout sections to reference site (statistics grid, services, expertise, guarantee, testimonials, footer)

Verified slider is using template‑based slides, not static image

3. Current Task (Active Right Now)

Populate this Markdown file with the chat context — done.

4. Next Task (Pending)

I’ll wait for your next instruction instead of stacking tasks.

5. Notes About Workflow Preferences

Your rules (implemented going forward):

No preambles

No “one more question” unless absolutely required

No comments like “Here’s the clean version”

One task at a time

No fluff

Keep responses lean, normal, and efficient

Don’t ask you to confirm what you already said

Keep conversation flow natural

6. Active Tech Stack Involved

WordPress (10Web hosting)

10Web Builder

Elementor

Elementor Templates (for hero slides)

Custom CSS injected via Customizer

7. Items to Review Later

Finish tuning hero slider animation + timing

Fix misaligned padding in mid‑sections

Update fonts + letter spacing so page feels tighter

Check mobile breakpoints (critical)

Improve footer spacing, padding, and column consistency

Double‑check navigation hover states + sticky behavior

Add subtle motion (fade‑ups, etc.)

8. Parked Requests

Create repo‑friendly downloadable MD file (you clarified you want a linkable file — will generate once content is locked)

Review TenWeb website for recent updates (blocked by browser context rules)

9. Waiting For You

Tell me the next move on the site and I’ll do it directly, one step at a time.
