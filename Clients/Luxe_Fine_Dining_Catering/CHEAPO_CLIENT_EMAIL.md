# Email to Cheapo Client - Project Discovery

**Purpose:** Get clear requirements so you can provide accurate pricing and scope

---

## Email Template

**Subject:** Quick form to figure out what you need

**Body:**
```
Hey [Name],

Let's figure out exactly what you need so I can give you accurate pricing and timeline.

I put together a quick project brief form - takes about 3-4 minutes to fill out:

[INSERT AIRTABLE FORM LINK HERE]

It asks about:
- What's broken or not working
- What you want to accomplish
- Timeline and budget range
- Any tools/platforms you're already using

Once I review it, I'll send you a proposal with mockups, pricing, and timeline within 48 hours. No phone calls required - everything in writing.

If you have questions about the form, just reply to this email.

## Follow-Up Email (If They Don't Respond in 3 Days)

**Subject:** Still interested in [project type]?

**Body:**
```
Hey [Name],

I sent over that project brief form a few days ago - wanted to check if you're still interested or if now's not the right time.

If you want to move forward, just fill out the form and I'll get you a proposal within 48 hours.

If it's not the right time, no worries. Just let me know and I'll check back in a few months.

- Jen

## Follow-Up Email (If They Say "Not Right Now")

**Subject:** Re: Still interested in [project type]?

**Body:**
```
No problem - I totally get it.

I'll check back in 3-6 months to see if timing's better then.

In the meantime, if anything changes or you have questions, you know where to find me.

- Jen

## What to Do After They Fill Out Form

**Within 24 hours:**

1. **Review their answers** - Understand what they need, budget, timeline
2. **Estimate the project** - Use PRICING_AND_SERVICES.md as your guide
3. **Decide if it's a fit:**
   - Is it within your scope?
   - Does their budget align with your pricing?
   - Can you deliver in their timeline?
   - Do they sound reasonable to work with?

4. **If YES, create proposal:**
   - Build Gamma mockup (2-3 slides showing concept)
   - Write proposal using template (see DENTAL_BUNNY_PROPOSAL.md for structure)
   - Send proposal email with link, pricing, next steps

5. **If NO, refer them out or decline:**
   ```
   Hey [Name],

   Thanks for filling that out. Based on what you're looking for, I don't think I'm the right fit because [reason: budget mismatch/outside my scope/timeline too tight].

   I'd recommend [suggestion: different type of provider/freelancer/platform].

   Good luck with the project!

   - Jen
