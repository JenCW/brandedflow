2. **Build calculator on your website** to help clients self-select
3. **Develop case studies** as you complete first clients
4. **Test Foundation package first** - prove value, then upsell
5. **Document your process** - turns into content and makes delivery easier

## CONFIDENCE NOTE

Your tech stack is PERFECT for this. Base 44 for client portals, n8n for automation, Airtable for CRM, Canva for design—these are exactly what successful automation agencies use. You're not just selling services; you're building with the same tools you're implementing for clients. That's authenticity.
