## 🎯 DOE METHOD (3-Question Test)
Before any task, ask:
1. Will this be done again? (Recurring)
2. Is this complex? (Multiple steps, integrations)
3. Does consistency matter? (Same quality every time)

**2+ Yes = Use DOE** → Check `systems/doe-engine/directives/{task-name}.md`
**0-1 Yes = Skip DOE** → Do it directly
