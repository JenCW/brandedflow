                    How long does a typical remodeling project take?

                </div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    Project timelines vary based on scope and complexity. A bathroom remodel typically takes 2-3 weeks, kitchen remodels take 4-6 weeks, and whole home renovations can take 2-4 months. We provide detailed timelines during our initial consultation and keep you updated throughout the project.

                <div class="faq-question">
                    Do I need to move out during the renovation?
                    <span class="faq-icon">+</span>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    It depends on the scope of work. For single-room renovations like bathrooms or kitchens, most clients stay in their homes. For whole-home remodels or major structural work, temporary relocation may be more comfortable. We work to minimize disruption and can discuss the best approach for your specific project.

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    Every project is unique, and costs depend on size, materials, complexity, and your specific requirements. After our initial consultation and site assessment, we provide a detailed, transparent estimate. We work with various budgets and can suggest value engineering options to meet your financial goals without compromising quality.

                    Absolutely. We handle all necessary permits and coordinate inspections with local authorities to ensure your project meets all building codes and regulations. This is included in our service, so you don't have to worry about navigating the permitting process.

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    We typically work with a deposit to begin work (usually 10-20%), progress payments at key milestones throughout the project, and final payment upon completion and your satisfaction. We provide transparent, detailed estimates upfront and never surprise you with hidden costs.

                    Hidden issues (like water damage, outdated wiring, or structural concerns) sometimes emerge during demolition. If we discover something unexpected, we'll stop work, document the issue, discuss solutions and costs with you, and get your approval before proceeding. We never make unauthorized changes.

                    We recommend contacting us 2-3 months before your desired start date, especially during busy seasons (spring and summer). This allows time for design, permitting, material ordering, and scheduling. However, we occasionally have earlier availability, so it never hurts to reach out sooner rather than later.
