# Branded + Flow: Autonomous Business System (Architecture + Build Plan)

This document defines exactly **what we are building**, **why**, and **how**.  
This is the working blueprint for the Branded + Flow “autonomous system.”

---

# 1. Purpose

Build a lightweight, small-business-friendly version of “autonomous marketing + operations” using Jen’s existing stack:

- **n8n** – automation engine  
- **Airtable** – database + asset store  
- **Base44** – CRM + lead capture  
- **Typeform** – intake + goal forms  
- **Canva Brand Hub** – branding + template engine  
- **Gamma** – instant documents  
- **ChatGPT** – content + logic generation  

The system must do one thing extremely well:

**A founder types what they want → the system builds it → the system runs it.**

---

# 2. Core Promise (Positioning)

> “Tell it what you want. It builds it. It runs it. It reminds you when you need to jump in.”

This becomes the product and the demo moment.

---

# 3. System Overview

The system has **two categories of workflows**:

1. **External Flows (for clients)**
   - Funnels (lead gen, nurture, offers)
   - Email/SMS sequences
   - Pages/assets
   - Lead routing
   - Performance summaries

2. **Internal Flows (for the business itself)**
   - Tasking
   - Onboarding
   - Daily accountability
   - Reports
   - Reminders
   - Ops automations

Both categories run through the same “engine.”

---

# 4. The Engine (High-Level Architecture)

The engine has three phases:

## **1. Input**
User fills out the “Tell Me What You Want” form via:
- **Typeform** or **Base44 form**

Inputs collected:
- Goal  
- Audience  
- Offer  
- Tone  
- Deliverables needed  
- Brand context  

## **2. Build**
ChatGPT + Brand Kit + Templates generate:
- Emails  
- SMS  
- Pages (Gamma or Canva)  
- Lead forms  
- Airtable records  
- Automation instructions  

Canva Brand Kit ensures visual consistency.  
Gamma produces formatted deliverables.

## **3. Activate**
n8n orchestrates:
- Create/update Airtable records  
- Push assets to Base44  
- Publish forms  
- Set follow-up automations  
- Trigger sequences  
- Send daily insights  
- Error-checking  

---

# 5. The Four “Agents” (Really Just Workflows)

## **1. Brand Agent**
- Pull brand kit from Canva  
- Output a ready-to-use brand profile for all flows  
- Enforce tone + voice rules  
- Store in Airtable for re-use  

## **2. Lead Agent**
- Create/update lead capture forms  
- Push form metadata to Base44  
- Map fields into Airtable tables  

## **3. Follow-Up Agent**
- Auto-generate 3–7 emails  
- Auto-generate SMS scripts  
- Store assets in Airtable  
- Activate n8n sequences  

## **4. Organizer Agent**
- Create tasks in Airtable  
- Send daily summary  
- Check for broken workflows  
- Track open items for the founder  

---

# 6. Infrastructure (What Lives Where)

## **Airtable**
Tables:
- Clients  
- Flows  
- Assets  
- Tasks  
- Logs  
- Brand Profiles  

## **n8n**
Core workflows:
- Intake → Asset Generation  
- Asset Generation → Airtable  
- Airtable → Base44  
- Follow-Up Sequence Activation  
- Daily Summary  
- Error Handler  
- Internal Tasks & Reminders  

## **Canva**
- Brand Kits  
- Locked templates for deliverables

## **Gamma**
- Lead magnet pages  
- Offer pages  
- One-pagers  
- Strategy docs  

## **Base44**
- CRM  
- Lead capture  
- Form hosting  

---

# 7. Demo Build (MVP)

We create ONE fully working end-to-end flow:

1. Intake form  
2. Brand Agent resolves tone + visuals  
3. Lead Agent builds a form  
4. Follow-Up Agent produces a 5-email sequence  
5. Gamma builds a lead magnet or offer page  
6. n8n publishes everything  
7. Airtable dashboard updates  
8. Daily summary emails send  

This demo becomes the selling tool.

---

# 8. Internal Dogfooding (Run B+F on B+F)

Before selling it:
- Build Jen’s brand kit  
- Build Jen’s lead system  
- Build Jen’s nurture system  
- Build Jen’s internal task + reminder automations  
- Build Jen’s daily summary  
- Use the system for 1 week  
- Optimize  

This becomes the “proof” and the testimonial.

## Phase 2 — Forms + Intake

## Phase 5 — Lead Agent  
- Generated forms  
- Mapping + routing  

## Phase 6 — Organizer Agent  
- Task generation

- Error logs  

## Phase 7 — Demo Recording  
- Full run-through  
- Simple 45–60 second video

# 10. Success Criteria

The system is considered “working” when:

1. A user types a goal  
2. The system produces:  
   - A branded form  
   - A lead route  
   - A formatted asset (Gamma/Canva)  
   - A follow-up sequence  
3. Leads flow into Base44+Airtable  
4. A dashboard updates automatically  
5. A daily summary is sent  
6. Zero manual copy/paste needed  

If all six conditions are met → the system is launch-ready.

# 11. Next Step

Decide naming for the engine. Options (working list):

- FlowEngine  
- AutoFlow  
- FlowOps  
- The Brain  
- Hands-Off HQ  
- The Do-It-For-You Desk  

We pick one before we start building.
