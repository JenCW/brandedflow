## Email Draft

**Subject:** Partnership terms for iAnswering.ai + Branded + Flow

**Body:**
```
Hey Richard,

I've been thinking about the partnership between iAnswering.ai and Branded + Flow. Here's what I'm proposing - let me know if this aligns with what you're thinking.

---

## What I'll Do for iAnswering.ai

**Immediate (Website Overhaul):**
- Complete website redesign for iAnswering.ai
- Brand refresh (if needed - logo, colors, visual identity)
- Sales/marketing pages optimized for AI search and conversions
- Lead capture and automation setup
- Professional presence that matches the quality of your product
- Timeline: [Your timeline - 2-3 weeks?]

**Ongoing (As Needed):**
- Website updates and maintenance
- Marketing material creation (landing pages, sales decks, lead magnets)
- Brand consistency across all channels
- CRM and automation improvements
- Support as the business grows

---

## What I Want in Return

I'm not looking for cash for the website work. I'm looking for strategic partnership that creates long-term value for both of us.

**Option 1: Revenue Share**
- X% of revenue from any client I refer to iAnswering.ai (ongoing)
- X% of revenue from AI receptionist setups I integrate as part of Branded + Flow client projects
- No equity, just rev-share on my referrals/integrations

**Option 2: Partnership Equity + White-Labeling Rights**
- X% equity/ownership stake in iAnswering.ai
- White-labeling rights (I can brand the AI receptionist as part of Branded + Flow's offering)
- Preferred provider status (I'm the go-to for all website/brand/marketing work)
- Revenue share on my direct referrals

**Option 3: Hybrid**
- Smaller equity stake (X%)
- Revenue share on my referrals
- White-labeling rights for my clients
- Preferred provider pricing (I get better rates than standard resellers)

**My preference:** Option 2 or 3 - I want to be invested in iAnswering.ai's success, not just a contractor.

---

## Why This Makes Sense

**What you get:**
- Professional website that converts (no cash cost to you)
- Ongoing marketing/brand support as you grow
- Access to my client network (small businesses who NEED AI receptionist services)
- Someone invested in making iAnswering.ai successful (not just collecting a fee)

**What I get:**
- A differentiator for Branded + Flow (AI receptionist as part of my offering)
- Ongoing revenue stream from referrals/integrations
- Equity in a product I believe in
- Strategic partnership with someone doing innovative work

**What our shared clients get:**
- Complete business system: professional brand + automated operations + 24/7 AI receptionist
- One point of contact (me) instead of piecing together multiple vendors
- Seamless integration between website/CRM and AI receptionist

---

## Proposed Partnership Terms

**Phase 1: Website Overhaul (Immediate)**
- I build the website/brand for iAnswering.ai
- You formalize partnership agreement (equity/rev-share/white-labeling)
- Timeline: [X weeks]
- Cost to you: $0 cash

**Phase 2: Ongoing Collaboration**
- I refer Branded + Flow clients who need AI receptionist → they become iAnswering.ai clients
- I integrate iAnswering.ai as part of my service offerings (with white-labeling if we agree on that)
- You handle the AI receptionist tech/support, I handle the website/brand/automation
- We split revenue based on agreed terms

**Revenue Share Model (Example):**
- If I refer a client who signs up for iAnswering.ai service: I get X% of their monthly recurring revenue (ongoing)
- If I include iAnswering.ai setup as part of a Branded + Flow project: I get X% of setup fee + X% of monthly recurring
- [We'd need to agree on specific percentages]

**Equity Model (If Applicable):**
- I receive X% equity in iAnswering.ai
- No cash investment from me (sweat equity via website/marketing work)
- Standard vesting schedule (if you want)
- Clear exit terms (if either of us wants out)

**White-Labeling Rights (If Applicable):**
- I can brand the AI receptionist as "Branded + Flow AI Receptionist (powered by iAnswering.ai)"
- OR I can sell it as iAnswering.ai with referral credit
- [Your preference here?]

## Alternative: Shorter, More Direct Version

**Subject:** Let's formalize the iAnswering.ai partnership

**Body:**
```
Hey Richard,

I'm ready to build the website for iAnswering.ai. Before I start, let's get the partnership terms in writing.

Here's what I'm thinking:

**I build your website/brand** (no cash cost to you)

**In exchange:**
- X% equity in iAnswering.ai, OR
- X% revenue share on clients I refer, OR
- White-labeling rights + rev-share on my integrations

**Why partnership vs. just paying me:**
I want to be invested in iAnswering.ai's success long-term, not just do a one-off project. I see real potential here and want to build something together.

**What I need from you:**
1. Which structure works for you? (Equity, rev-share, or hybrid)
2. What percentages are you comfortable with?
3. When do you need the website done?

Let me know what you're thinking and we can formalize it.

- Jen
```

## Key Considerations Before Sending

**Do you know:**
1. ✅ What Richard originally proposed (if anything)?
2. ✅ What's standard in his industry for partnerships?
3. ✅ What iAnswering.ai's current business model is (pricing, margins)?
4. ✅ If he's open to equity partnerships vs. just rev-share?
5. ✅ What his timeline is for the website?

**If you DON'T know these things:**
Start with a shorter, more exploratory email:

```
Hey Richard,

Before I start on the iAnswering.ai website, let's talk partnership structure.

I'm interested in a long-term partnership (equity/rev-share/white-labeling) rather than just getting paid for the website. I see the potential in iAnswering.ai and want to be invested in its success.

What were you thinking in terms of partnership terms? I'm flexible on structure - just want to make sure we're both getting value.

Let me know what you had in mind and we can formalize it.

- Jen
```

## Things to Negotiate

**If he offers too little:**
- "I appreciate the offer, but for the amount of work I'm putting in (website + ongoing marketing + referrals), I'd need at least X% to make it worth my while."

**If he wants you to do too much:**
- "I can do the website and brand refresh, but ongoing updates would need to be part of a retainer or separate agreement."

**If he balks at equity:**
- "No problem - let's do rev-share instead. X% of any client I refer, ongoing. Clean and simple."

**If he wants exclusivity:**
- "I'm happy to make iAnswering.ai my preferred AI receptionist partner, but I can't commit to exclusivity since my clients have different needs."

---

## Red Flags to Watch For

🚩 **He's vague about terms** - Push for specifics before you start work
🚩 **He wants you to invest cash** - This should be sweat equity only
🚩 **He won't put it in writing** - No work without a signed agreement
🚩 **He keeps changing the scope** - Agree on deliverables upfront
🚩 **He delays formalizing terms** - Don't start work without agreement

---

## Ideal Outcome

**Best case scenario:**
- 5-10% equity in iAnswering.ai (vested over time)
- White-labeling rights (you can sell it as part of Branded + Flow)
- 20-30% rev-share on direct referrals
- Preferred provider pricing (better rates than standard resellers)
- Ongoing retainer for website/marketing support ($297-$697/month)

**Minimum acceptable:**
- 20-30% rev-share on your referrals/integrations
- White-labeling rights OR clear referral credit
- Website project scope clearly defined
- Written partnership agreement

**Walk-away point:**
- If he wants you to do significant work for vague "future" benefits
- If he won't formalize terms in writing
- If he expects exclusivity without fair compensation
- If the scope keeps expanding without additional value to you
