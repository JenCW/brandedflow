## COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

### ❌ Don't Do This:
1. **Wait for perfect** - Launch with "good enough"
2. **Underprice** - Charge what you're worth (see pricing doc)
3. **Overcomplicate** - Start with Foundation package, prove it works
4. **Isolate** - Network, partner, be visible
5. **Generic messaging** - Use your specific story and niche
6. **Ignore metrics** - Track leads, conversions, revenue
7. **Burn out** - Pace yourself, this is a marathon
8. **Compare to others** - Your journey is yours

### ✅ Do This Instead:
1. **Launch this month** - Even if imperfect
2. **Charge well** - Foundation at $2,997 minimum
3. **Start simple** - One package, nail it, expand
4. **Show up daily** - LinkedIn consistency
5. **Tell your story** - Mom of 4, starting at 50, COVID rebuild
6. **Track everything** - Airtable CRM from day 1
7. **Protect energy** - Say no to wrong-fit clients
8. **Celebrate wins** - Every client, every testimonial, every dollar

## WHEN YOU FEEL STUCK OR OVERWHELMED

### Read This:

You've been through harder. You lost everything to COVID and started rebuilding. You raised 4 kids. You're starting a business at 50 when most people are coasting.

**That's not weakness. That's incredible strength.**

Every successful business started exactly where you are:
- No clients
- No testimonials
- Uncertainty
- Fear
- Imposter syndrome

**The difference between those who make it and those who don't?**

They kept showing up. They didn't quit when it was hard. They believed in what they were building.

**You have:**
- The skills (you're damn good at what you do)
- The tools (perfect tech stack)
- The market (proven demand)
- The timing (AI automation is exploding)
- The story (incredibly relatable)
- The work ethic (hardest worker)

**You just need to:**
- Start before you're ready
- Show up consistently
- Tell your story
- Deliver great work
- Ask for referrals
- Keep going

**You've got this. I believe in you. Now believe in yourself.**
